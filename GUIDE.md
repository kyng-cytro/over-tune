# Over Tune – Guide

Over Tune is pretty straightforward to use.

Once installed, it enables default shortcuts:

- **Play / Pause** → `Ctrl + Space`
- **Next Track** → `Shift + Alt + 0`
- **Previous Track** → `Shift + Alt + 9`

Don't worry — these are fully customizable and easy to change.
Just click on the extension from the Chrome bar and hit the **Edit Shortcuts** button.
From there, you can set any shortcut for any action.
_I recommend making them **global** so they work even when Chrome isn't focused._

## Audio Devices

Over Tune also supports switching audio devices.

That's why you saw the scary **microphone permission** prompt the first time you opened it.
👉 Don’t worry: the mic itself is never used. The permission is only needed so Chrome can list your available audio devices.

If you don’t care about switching devices, you can safely deny it.
But if you allow it, you'll be able to route YouTube Music to a specific device without affecting the rest of your system's audio. Pretty neat! 🎶

## Custom Action

There is one available **Custom Action**, which can be bound to any keyboard shortcut of your choice.

For example, you can bind it to `Ctrl + Alt + 1` to focus the YTM tab or window.

### How to set it up

1. Scroll down to **Shortcuts** and locate **Custom Action**.
2. Select one of the available actions from the dropdown.
3. Click **Edit Shortcuts** and assign your preferred key combination.

## Remote Companion

Over Tune supports a **Remote Companion**, which lets you control Over Tune from another device.

The Remote Companion uses a pairing mechanism, so you’ll need to pair it with your other device before use. To do this, go to the **Settings** page, enable **Networking**, and click **Add Device**.

Once paired, you’ll be able to control playback from your other device.

> ⚠️ **Beta & Security Notice**
> The Remote Companion is currently in **beta**. This means it may be unstable and should not be considered fully secure.

## FAQ

**Is Over Tune free?**
Yeah, totally. I built this to make my life a little more convenient, and figured why not share it with others.

**Does Over Tune have access to my mic?**
Nope. Over Tune never listens to or records your mic.
The permission prompt comes from YouTube Music itself, because Chrome requires it to list audio output devices.

**Does Over Tune store data?**
Not really. By default, aside from fonts (pulled from Google Fonts — yes, they should probably be bundled 😅), Over Tune does not connect to the internet in any way.
Over Tune does store your preferred device ID and Settings, but this is kept entirely in your browser’s local storage.
This changes slightly if you enable **Networking** and use the **Remote Companion**. In that case, Over Tune generates device IDs and stores them in the cloud solely for pairing between your devices.

## We still do **not** store your listening data or any other sensitive personal information. 😅
