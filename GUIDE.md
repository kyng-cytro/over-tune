# Over Tune â€“ Guide

Over Tune is pretty straightforward to use.

Once installed, it enables default shortcuts:

- **Play / Pause** â†’ `Ctrl + Space`
- **Next Track** â†’ `Shift + Alt + 0`
- **Previous Track** â†’ `Shift + Alt + 9`

Don't worry â€” these are fully customizable and easy to change.
Just click on the extension from the Chrome bar and hit the **Edit Shortcuts** button.
From there, you can set any shortcut for any action.
_I recommend making them **global** so they work even when Chrome isn't focused._

## Audio Devices

Over Tune also supports switching audio devices.

That's why you saw the scary **microphone permission** prompt the first time you opened it.
ðŸ‘‰ Donâ€™t worry: the mic itself is never used. The permission is only needed so Chrome can list your available audio devices.

If you donâ€™t care about switching devices, you can safely deny it.
But if you allow it, you'll be able to route YouTube Music to a specific device without affecting the rest of your system's audio. Pretty neat! ðŸŽ¶

## FAQ

**Is Over Tune free?**
Yeah, totally. I built this to make my life a little more convenient, and figured why not share it with others.

**Does Over Tune have access to my mic?**
Nope. Over Tune never listens to or records your mic.
The permission prompt comes from YouTube Music itself, because Chrome requires it to list audio output devices.

**Does Over Tune store data?**
Not really. Outside of fonts (pulled from Google Fonts â€” yeah, I should probably bundle those ðŸ˜…), Over Tune doesn't reach out to the internet in any way.
Over Tune does store your preferred device ID, but it's right in your browser's local storage.
